                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>The Women Tech Network reports that females make up 25% of all C-suite leadership roles with only 5%
                        held by female POC. We believe the fastest route to female success lies in the support and empowerment of women 
                        by women. The leading factor with encouraging women into the tech industry is "if you can't see it,
                        you can't be it".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is to play our part in increasing the global average of women in tech including people of colour from 28% to 50% by 2030.
                        We hope by facilitating meaningful engagement between female tech leaders of today and the next generation our platform can
                        contribute to the upward trajectory of women in tech.

                    <h3>History of Women in Tech</h3>
                    <p>
                       Even when women have been treated as designated second class citizens, we haven't stopped creating history. From the 19th Century
                       when women were forced to choose between marriage and a career, successive generations of women have pushed the boundaries of what
                       was possible and carved a path for future generations to follow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From early pioneers like Ada Lovelace, to the thousands of women who played crucial roles in the codebreaking operation at Bletchley
                        Park during World War II and on to Annie Easly, who wrote programs that took the Apollo missions to moon, we see the role women in tech
                        play in world events. These achievements inspire the next generation of women to push the boundaries even further.
